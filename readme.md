<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 The software is for managing the patient records and patient appointments for the Medical Center.  

The current system used at the centre is not efficient in many ways. There is no way for patients to view previous and upcoming appointments. There is no link between appointments and patients records databases making searching/updating records for admin staff more time consuming, this also makes reviewing patient history more time consuming for doctors.  

The new software aims to create a simple but dynamic solution to the above problems.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The software is for three end-users,  

1. The patients registered at the Medical Center, 

2. The doctors who work at the Medical Center,  

3. The Administration staff who work in the Medical Center

The usage of the app has some differences based on who is the end user. 

Patients - 

To log in as a patient ensure you are on the patient login path.
You can user the details - username:AFern@gmail.com , password:fern2000

![Patient-Login](/Screenshots/Login-Patient.png)

Upon logging you will see the home screen for patients 

![Patient-Home-Screen](/Screenshots/Patient-Home1.png)

The patient information is shown on the user datails card, which you are able to edit as the patient. 

![Patient-Edit-Card](/Screenshots/Patient-Edit-Details.png)

On successful edit you should see the below and the card should automatically update the edited details.

Navigate to the appointments page to see all appointments for the patient.

![Patient-Appointments](/Screenshots/Patient-Appointments.png)

These are split in to two categories, upcoming and previous.

![Upcoming](/Screenshots/Patient-Appointments-Upcoming.png)

![Previous](/Screenshots/Patient-Appointments-Previous.png)




Doctors - 

To login as a doctor ensure you navigate to the Staff Login section of the login screen
you can use the details - username:TJ@hotmail.com , password:hiTom,

![Doc-Login](/Screenshots/Doctor-Login.png)

Like the patient home page doctors details will come up on their home page, these can be edited also.

![Doc-Home](/Screenshots/Doctor-Home-Page.png)

You will now see an additional page (patients) on the nav bar, 

Navigate to the patients page. Doctors can use this page to search patient records. For example 
if they have an appointment with a patient who has been to the clinic before with a previous issue and want 
to familiarise themselves with the patients history, they can do this here. 

![Doc-Patients](/Screenshots/Doctor-Patient-Page.png)

They can query the patient database by either - patient name, unregistered or all patients. 
On search if the patient exists their record will be retireved, of which the doctor will be able to 
see in full.

![Doc-Patient-Record](/Screenshots/Doctor-Patient-Record.png)

![Doc-Patient-Record-2](/Screenshots/Doctor-Patient-Record-2.png)

In addition to this Doctors can create a new patient record. 


Navigate to the appoinments page and we can see doctors have the ability to query the appoinments 
section of the database by, date, all, patient name, doctor name etc 

![Doc-Appointments](/Screenshots/Appointment-Filter.png)

An example of a returned appointment item.

![Doc-Appointments-Card](/Screenshots/Appointment-Card-Doctor.png)

They can also edit appointments, primarily the appoinment notes of what was discussed/done with the 
patient during the appointment. 

![Doc-Appointments-Edit](/Screenshots/Edit-Appointment-Doctor.png)

![Doc-Appointments-Edit2](/Screenshots/Edit-Appointment-Doctor-2.png)

![Doc-Appointments-Edit3](/Screenshots/Edit-Apointment-Doctor-3.png)

![Doc-Appointments-Edit4](/Screenshots/Edit-Apointment-Doctor-4.png)


They have the ability to archive the appointment which onclick will add the appointment to the patient
record and remove the permission to edit the appointment record any further. 

![Doc-Appointments-Archive](/Screenshots/Archive1.png)

![Doc-Appointments-Archive](/Screenshots/Archive2.png)

![Doc-Appointments-Archive](/Screenshots/Archive3.png)

In addition to this they can also create new appointments.




Admins - 

Admins have the most usability in the app. However there are some differences. 
To login as an admin use the details - username:admin@clinic.com, password:admin1
![Admin-Login](/Screenshots/Login-Admin.png)

Like doctors admins can search for patient records although the retrieved records will ommit any confidential information from appointments.
![Admin-Patient-Card](/Screenshots/Admin-Patient-Card.png)

![Admin-Patient-Card](/Screenshots/Patient-Card-Expanded-Admin.png)

They can create new patient records like doctors. 
Admins have the unique permission to edit patient records and delete patient records.
Any changes made will automatically update on the record. 

![Admin-Patient-Record](/Screenshots/Edit-Patient-Admin.png)

In the appoinments section admins can query the database in the same way as doctors and like with patient records, 
will only be able to see the non-confidential information on the appointment card. 

![Admin-Appointment-Card](/Screenshots/Appointment-Card-Admin.png)

They can edit and delete appoinments but they cannot archive appointment as this action is reserved for doctors once the appointment has been completed. Once archived appointments can only be deleted.

![Admin-Archived](/Screenshots/Archived-Appointment-Admin.png)

The section that is exclusive to admins only is the users path. 
Navigate to the user page, like the patients page admins can query the database for the doctor & admin information of those that work at the clinic. 

![Admin-User-Page](/Screenshots/User%20Page%20Admin.png)

They can create new users, edit their information and delete users from the datatbase. 

![Admin-User1](/Screenshots/User-Card-Admin.png)

![Admin-User2](/Screenshots/User-Card-Updated-Admin.png);

<!-- Testing -->
## Testing

To run the tests on the app simply go to the terminal and type in 
    ```
    npm test
    ```
. Provided the project has been installed correctly the backend test suite will run, and then the frontend 
test will run. It should appear as follows:
![Test1](/Screenshots/Test.png)
![Test2](/Screenshots/Test1.png)
![Test3](/Screenshots/Test2.png)

<!-- Deployment -->
## Deployment 
* [Deployment Link](https://victorious-beanie-fly.cyclic.app/)

The full project has been deployed to Cyclic. 
The reason for this is Cyclic allows full stack deploys with some minimal changes. 
The fontend of the project was built with npm build and using the below code in the index.js file
on the sever side. We can access the frontend via localhost:5000 with all the same pathways that 
would exist in the frontend react app. 

![Server-Access-To-Build](/Screenshots/Build-Code.png)

On initial deployment there were some challenges. 

- Environment variables (.ENV) are not automatically configured by Cyclic so that needed to be added separatley.

- Npm start conflicts. To access this project locally the start scripts outlined in the package.json file
will install the required dependancies and then run the backend and frontend respectivley. In deployment
this was causing a fatal error which would'nt allow the deployment to run correctly. 

Cyclic runs it's deployments with the npm start command and automatically updates from new git commits.

As the frontend is accessed via the backend with the above code and the frontend has been built with npm build.
Rather than starting the frontend as we would normally with npm start we only need the server to be running. 
So the ending start script for the build was "start":"node index.js" . 

This however created a problem in itself, the requirement for the project stated that user need to be able to download the git repo and run the project with npm start. In the above configuration on npm start none of the 
dependancies would be installed and the project would fail to compile. 
A secondary git repo was created to hold the code for the local copy of the project, this alows users who wish to locally install the project to do so without having to change any start scripts. 


<!-- Future Changes -->
## Future Changes

For this project time constraints were a factor. So I have listed below some of the future changes I would like to make to the App to increase it's functionality.

- Integrate with a calendar so app is more functional as an appointment management system.

- Allow Admin & Doctors to set appointments based on what is available in the calendar.

- Add other login routes/verification for users i.e google, facebook.

- Increase responsiveness to mobile phones, currently on mobile screens app looks as follows:
